<h1>Alarm panel</h1>
<h2>Config</h2>
<p>The config is XML (though JSON can be used), and is described below.</p>
<h2>Groups</h2>
<p>The operation of the system is divided in to groups, typically allowing independent operation of sets of sensors and outputs, i.e. multiple alarms.</p>
<p>However, sensors and outputs and keypads and so on can be shared between groups - e.g. an input can be an alarm triggering (intruder) that is an input to more than one group at a time. Similarly an output such as a bell could be an output for more than one group. This means, in effect, groups can overlap.</p>
<p>Groups are numbered 0 to 9 to allow working with the keypad.</p>
<h3>Group states</h3>
<p>States are per group. The full list is included below in the <tt>output</tt> config section.</p>
<ul>
<li>The lowest level of input is <i>warning</i>. This creates a log and a warning state. The warning state clears automatically when all warnings clear.</li>
<li>The <i>fault</i> state is for faults, such as high or low resistance on inputs. This is latched, and has to be cleared by a user reset. The fault state does not stop operation.</li>
<li>The <i>tamper</i> state is for wiring issues, and this causes an alert on keypads at any time (expect in engineering mode, where it is expected). This is latched and have to be cleared by user reset. The <i>tamper</i> state, when the intruder alarm is set, causes an <i>alarm</i> state.</li>
<li>The <i>intruder</i> state is for inputs that indicate an intruder. The inputs create an <i>open</i> state but when the alarm is set the inputs cause a latching <i>intruder</i> state and trigger an alarm. There are <i>entry</i> inputs which trigger an <i>entry</i> state for a period before an alarm and then will trigger <i>intruder</i> states as well.</li>
<li>The <i>fire</i> state is for fire alarm inputs, and this cases an alarm even when the intruder alarm is not set. This is also latched and cleared by user reset.</li>
<li>The <i>alarm</i> state is where there is an intruder or fire alarm. It is triggered by tamper as well when the alarm is set. The alarm causes the bell output (which can also be delayed).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Timed events</h3>
<p>Some aspects are linked to timers, for example when setting the alarm in a group there is a time for relevant inputs to settle, and the timer restarts if they are triggered. There is also a longer timer for the alarm to set overall, and if this is exceeded (i.e. because the setting timer keeps resetting) that means the alarm has failed to set, which is an important event to report.</p>
<p>There are also some timers on things like the bell output, which should only ring so long. It makes sense that there is a recovery timer too, so if not rung for a while and a new alarm event happens even though alarm is set, the bell starts again.</p>
<p>The alarm setting also has possible delays. A simple delay before causing alarm state to allow entry to get to keypad to unset, for example. There may also want to be delays before bells ring allowing some silent reporting first.</p>
<h2>Keypads</h2>
<p>Keypads allow some basic operations - reporting status, and allowing use of PIN to clear alarm, set alarm, etc.</p>
<p>A keypad is in one or more groups, and so only shows status and allows setting/controls for those groups. When in more than one group some operations ask which groups to apply the operation to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting alarm with a timer by use of <tt>A</tt> key. During the timer groups can be removed from those being set. Use <tt>ENT</tt> to then set instantly.</li>
<li>Instant set of the alarm by use of the <tt>B</tt> key.</li>
<li>Enter PIN for user to log in. This unsets the intruder alarm. This shows more details of latched states, etc.</li>
<li>Enter PIN again when logged in to reset latched states.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Doors</h2>
<p>Doors make use of a number of settings to create a logical entity in their own right.</p>
<p>The settings allow one or two max readers, inputs for exit buttons, input for door open sensor, outputs to open the door and to deadlock the door with lock engaged sensors. The system then manages a door state tracking things like door propped, door forced, door ajar, etc.</p>
<h2>Inputs</h2>
<p>Inputs can be via RIO or Max. For the RIO the inputs have physical parameters (response time, and resistance thresholds). Whilst the RIOs have 8 inputs there are additional logical inputs for High Res and Low Res states which typically get used to trigger a fault.</p>
<p>Inputs are then linked to groups using a bit map.</p>
<ul>
<li>Response times (RIO only)</li>
<li>Resistor thresholds (RIO only)</li>
<li>Intruder: Defines groups where this input being open is an intruder event, causing alarm when alarm is set, and ignored when not.</li>
<li>Fire: Defines groups where this input being open is a fire alarm. This alarms whether alarm is set or not.</li>
<li>Warning: Defines groups where this input indicates a warning condition.</li>
<li>Fault: Defines groups where this input being open is considered a fault condition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a tamper on any input that is in use for any of the above in a group causes a fault condition too.</p>
<p>A logical input also exists for device missing, and tamper on the device level.</p>
<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>For each group a number of logical outputs exist - obviously the main states as described above, but also some derived state such as BELL which only continues for a time period whilst alarm is set.</p>
<p>Each actual output has the option to connect logically to these group outputs.</p>
<p>In addition to RIO and Max, the beeper on Keypad and Max are considered outputs as well. On the keypad there are different types of beep which are treated as different outputs. This allows them to be linked to alarm state, or pre-alarm or pre-set, etc.</p>
<p>RIO outputs may need polarity setting, and do we need pulse/latch type settings somehow?</p>
<h2>Users</h2>
<p>Users relate to actual people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>PIN for keypad use - sadly these need to be unique, and would suggest long</li>
<li>Password for web interface</li>
<li>Key fob number(s) - allow use to have more than one fob, or same fob as read by keypad and max (they have different codes for same fob).</li>
<li>Groups the user can interact with at all</li>
<li>Groups the user can set alarm</li>
<li>Groups the user can unset alarm</li>
<li>Groups the user can reset fire and fault</li>
<li>Groups the user can override door propped</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rooms</h2>
<p>We may want a concept of rooms?</p>
<h2>Airlock doors</h2>
<p>We should definitely have that as a system</p>
<h2>Logging and reporting</h2>
<p>Events are logged in an internal logging system that writes to system.</p>
<p>However, events can also be configured to be handled in other ways including emailing and posting to a web page.</p>
<h1>Config</h1>
<p>The config consists of a number of objects as described below.</p>
<h2>Device/port IDs</h2>
<p>The alarm panel needs to reference ports, and display them. In the XML, ports can be references by either the port name (defined for input or output) or its address.</p>
<p>Port addresses are made up of:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>XXX</tt> port type, e.g. <tt>PAD</tt>, <tt>RIO</tt>, <tt>RFR</tt> or <tt>MAX</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>B</tt> bus ID, <tt>1</tt> to <tt>9</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>AA</tt> bus hexadecimal address, <tt>00</tt> to <tt>FF</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>P</tt> port <tt>1</tt> to <tt>8</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases the port is not needed, e.g. referencing just the device.</p>
<p>In some cases more than one port or device can be specified, in which case a space separated list is used.</p>
